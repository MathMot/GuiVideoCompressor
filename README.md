# GUI Video Compressor
---
GUI Video Compressor is a tool with a very nice User Interface to compress video files (only mp4 for now) into any desired size.
It works using Two-pass encoding and FFMPEG for video encoding.

## Features
- Windows & Linux compatibility
- Add multiple video to compress at once
- Edit freely the output FPS of the videos while maintaining the desired FPS
- Preview any video with its thumbnail by hovering it in order to help sorting multiple videos
- Multiple app themes available (depending on what's on your os)
- Settings are saved between sessions
- Only requires FFMPEG and FFPROBE to work (you can chose which version to use)
## How it works

- Select all of your videos from your file explorer
- Set your desired size
- Set your output FPS (optional)
- Set the output path (You can chose to clear it before compressing)
- And press the Compress button (a progress bar helps you estimate a duration)
